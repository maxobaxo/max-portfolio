        <h3>About Max</h3>
        <p>Max Scher is a passionate and committed web programmer. Born in San Francisco, raised in Southern California, Max brings a broad range of experiences and skills to his career in web development. After a brief stint as an actor in Los Angeles, Max spent eight years climbing the corporate ladder at an independent film studio, beginning as an assistant and ultimately serving as Executive Director of Sales in the theatrical distribution department.</p>
        <p>In early 2016, Max and his wife moved to <span class="text-success">Oregon</span> in anticipation of welcoming their first child. During nine months in outside sales for a software company, Max came to realize that a long career in sales would be a soul-crushing existence. So, he decided to change career directions, and pivot towards a long-neglected hobby.</p>
        <p> Over the years, Max had tinkered with free online coding courses, and really enjoyed the brief time he spent navigating basic <span class="code-lang">HTML</span> and <span class="code-lang">JavaScript</span>. After spending a few months with Hack Reactor's free online bootcamp-prep course, Max decided to jump in full-force and commit to a future in web programming by enrolling in a bootcamp with <a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> in Portland.</p>
        <p>After only a few days, <em>Max is thrilled with his decision</em> and looks forward to this challenging and <strong>rewarding</strong> new profession.</p>
